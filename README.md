# ChallengesGoldBadge
Welcome to my Gold Badge Challenges!
I have completed challenges 1-3 and done my very best.
01 Challenges allows you to navigate a cafe menu by updating, adding, deleting and view the menu items.
02 Challenges allows you to view insurance claims listed, view the next one, edit, and delete them.
03 Challenges allows yoou to view what badge numbers have access to what doors, change the doors, or delete the doors. 

C# was used for all the coding and was created on Visual Studio

If you need assistance using these challenges, please reach out to me, Mary Carole Scannell at scannellm94@gmail.com
All code was created by Mary Carole Scannell with assistance and collaboration from teachers and students in the SD 71B 11-9-20 Gold class at ElevenFifty.
